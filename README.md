# Shooting Cases in the United States: A Comprehensive Evaluation (Jan 2015â€“June 2020)



## Introduction

Welcome to the repository for the evaluation of shooting cases across the United States of America from January 2015 to June 2020. This project aims to shed light on the often-heated argument that a particular race has consistently been the victim of shootings, leading to turmoil and chaos across the nation. The primary objective of this report is to present an unbiased analysis of the available data to determine whether such claims hold true.
